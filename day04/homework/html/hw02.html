<h1><u>Brown Trout</u></h1>

<h2> Brown trout (Salmo trutta) are a widely distributed species of salmonid fish native to Europe, North Africa, and western Asia, but now found on every continent except Antarctica due to their introduction for recreational angling. They are known for their adaptive nature, thriving in diverse habitats from rivers and streams to lakes and even the sea. Brown trout are opportunistic feeders, consuming a variety of prey including insects, small fish, and even 
<br>
other trout. They are also a popular game fish and can be found in many parts of the world. 
Here are some more specific facts about brown trout:
Appearance and Size:
Brown trout typically have a light brown or tawny coloration with pronounced black spots on their back, sides, and head. 
They often have reddish halos around their spots and reddish spots on their sides.
<br> 
Adult brown trout usually range from 14-20 inches and 1-2 pounds, but some can reach 10 pounds. 
The world record brown trout weighed 44 pounds, 5 ounces. 
Habitat and Behavior:
They prefer cool, oxygenated water and can tolerate a wider temperature range than many other coldwater fish. 
Brown trout are territorial and can become increasingly nocturnal during spring and summer. 
They are adaptable and can thrive in various water bodies, including streams, lakes, and even the sea. 
They can change their color to camouflage with their surroundings. 
Diet:
Brown trout are opportunistic feeders, consuming a wide variety of prey, including insects, small fish, crayfish, mollusks, and even small mammals. 
They can become more piscivorous (fish-eating) as they get larger. 
Spawning and Reproduction:
Spawning occurs between January and March when females lay their eggs in gravelly beds. 
Male trout will defend the nest until the female is ready to lay eggs. 
Fertilized eggs are buried in the gravel. 
<br>
A typical female brown trout produces about 2,000 eggs per kilogram of body weight. 
Lifespan and Growth:
Brown trout can live for many years, with some individuals reaching ages in excess of 10 years in naturalized populations. 
Some individuals have been found to be over 35 years old.
<br> 
Growth rates vary depending on the type of water body, with faster growth in lakes and slower growth in streams. 
Other Interesting Facts:
Brown trout are a popular game fish, and their recreational angling appeal has led to their introduction to many parts of the world. 
They can be difficult to catch, especially during the summer months when they become increasingly nocturnal. 
<br>
Brown trout are indicators of ecosystem health, and their presence or absence can be a sign of the health of a water body. </h2>

<h1><u>Tiger Trout</u></h1>
<h2>The tiger trout (Salmo trutta × Salvelinus fontinalis) is a sterile, intergeneric hybrid of the brown trout (Salmo trutta) and the brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis). Pronounced vermiculations in the fish's patterning gave rise to its name, evoking the stripes of a tiger. Tiger trout are a rare anomaly in the wild, as the parent species are relatively distantly related, being members of different genera and possessing mismatched numbers of chromosomes.[1][2][3] However, specialized hatchery rearing techniques are able to produce tiger trout reliably enough to meet the demands of stocking programs.[4][5]</h2>

<h1><u> Great White Sharks</u></h1>
<h2>The great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias), also known as the white shark, white pointer, or simply great white, is a species of large mackerel shark which can be found in the coastal surface waters of all the major oceans. It is the only known surviving species of its genus Carcharodon. The great white shark is notable for its size, with the largest preserved female specimen measuring 5.83 m (19.1 ft) in length and around 2,000 kg (4,400 lb) in weight at maturity.[3] However, most are smaller; males measure 3.4 to 4.0 m (11 to 13 ft), and females measure 4.6 to 4.9 m (15 to 16 ft) on average.[4][5] According to a 2014 study, the lifespan of great white sharks is estimated to be as long as 70 years or more, well above previous estimates,[6] making it one of the longest lived cartilaginous fishes currently known.[7] According to the same study, male great white sharks take 26 years to reach sexual maturity, while the females take 33 years to be ready to produce offspring.[8] Great white sharks can swim at speeds of 25 km/h (16 mph)[9] for short bursts and to depths of 1,200 m (3,900 ft).[10]

The great white shark is arguably the world's largest-known extant macropredatory fish, and is one of the primary predators of marine mammals, such as pinnipeds and dolphins. The great white shark is also known to prey upon a variety of other animals, including fish, other sharks, and seabirds. It has only one recorded natural predator, the orca.[11][12]

The species faces numerous ecological challenges which has resulted in international protection. The International Union for Conservation of Nature lists the great white shark as a vulnerable species,[1] and it is included in Appendix II of CITES.[13] It is also protected by several national governments, such as Australia (as of 2018).[14] Due to their need to travel long distances for seasonal migration and extremely demanding diet, it is not logistically feasible to keep great white sharks in captivity; because of this, while attempts have been made to do so in the past, there are no known aquariums in the world believed to house a live specimen.[15]

The great white shark is depicted in popular culture as a ferocious man-eater, largely as a result of the novel Jaws by Peter Benchley and its subsequent film adaptation by Steven Spielberg. While humans are not a preferred prey,[16] this species is nonetheless responsible for the largest number of reported and identified fatal unprovoked shark attacks on humans.[17] However, attacks are rare, typically occurring fewer than 10 times per year globally.[18][19] </h2>

<h1><u>BlueGill</u></h1>

<h2>The bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus), sometimes referred to as "bream", "brim", "sunny", or, in Texas, "copper nose",[3] is a species of North American freshwater fish, native to and commonly found in streams, rivers, lakes, ponds and wetlands east of the Rocky Mountains. It is the type species of the genus Lepomis (true sunfish), from the family Centrarchidae (sunfishes, crappies and black basses) in the order Centrarchiformes.

Bluegills can grow up to 16 in (41 cm) long and about 4+1⁄2 lb (2.0 kg). While their color can vary from population to population, they typically have a very distinctive coloring, with deep blue and purple on the face and gill cover, dark olive-colored bands down the side, and a fiery orange to yellow belly. They are omnivorous and will consume anything they can fit in their mouth, but mostly feed on small aquatic insects and baitfishes. The fish are important prey for bass, other larger sunfish, northern pike and muskellunge, walleye, trout, herons, kingfishers, snapping turtles and otters, and play a key role within the food chain of its freshwater ecosystem.

A popular panfish among anglers, bluegill usually hide around and inside old tree stumps in swamps and other underwater structures (e.g. snags), and can live in either deep or very shallow water. Bluegills also like to find shelter among aquatic plants and in the shade of trees along banks, and will often move from one cover to another depending on the time of day or season.</h2>

<h2>An anchovy is a small, common forage fish of the family Engraulidae. Most species are found in marine waters, but several will enter brackish water, and some in South America are restricted to fresh water.[3]

More than 140 species are placed in 16 genera; they are found in the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans, and in the Black Sea and the Mediterranean Sea. Anchovies are usually classified as oily fish.[4]</h2>

<h1><u>Plankton</u></h1>
<h2>Plankton are microscopic or near-microscopic organisms that drift in aquatic environments,
 unable to propel themselves against water currents. They are broadly classified into phytoplankton (plant-like) and zooplankton (animal-like). Plankton play a vital role in marine and freshwater ecosystems,
 forming the base of many food webs and contributing significantly to oxygen production. </h2>

<h1><u>Moullusca</u></h1>
<h2>Mollusca is a phylum of protostomic invertebrate animals, whose members are known as molluscs or mollusks[b] (/ˈmɒləsks/). Around 76,000 extant species of molluscs are recognized, making it the second-largest animal phylum after Arthropoda.[6] The number of additional fossil species is estimated between 60,000 and 100,000,[7] and the proportion of undescribed species is very high. Many taxa remain poorly studied.[8]
Molluscs are the largest marine phylum, comprising about 23% of all the named marine organisms. They are highly diverse, not just in size and anatomical structure, but also in behaviour and habitat, as numerous groups are freshwater and even terrestrial species. The phylum is typically divided into 7 or 8 taxonomic classes,[9] of which two are entirely extinct. Cephalopod molluscs, such as squid, cuttlefish, and octopuses, are among the most neurologically advanced of all invertebrates—and either the giant squid or the colossal squid is the largest known extant invertebrate species. The gastropods (snails, slugs and abalone) are by far the most diverse class and account for 80% of the total classified molluscan species.
The four most universal features defining modern molluscs are a soft body composed almost entirely of muscle, a mantle with a significant cavity used for breathing and excretion, the presence of a radula (except for bivalves), and the structure of the nervous system. Other than these common elements, molluscs express great morphological diversity, so many textbooks base their descriptions on a "hypothetical ancestral mollusc" (see image below). This has a single, "limpet-like" shell on top, which is made of proteins and chitin reinforced with calcium carbonate, and is secreted by a mantle covering the whole upper surface. The underside of the animal consists of a single muscular "foot".
Although molluscs are coelomates, the coelom tends to be small. The main body cavity is a hemocoel through which blood circulates; as such, their circulatory systems are mainly open. The "generalized" mollusc's feeding system consists of a rasping "tongue", the radula, and a complex digestive system in which exuded mucus and microscopic, muscle-powered "hairs" called cilia play various important roles. The generalized mollusc has two paired nerve cords, or three in bivalves. The brain, in species that have one, encircles the esophagus.
Most molluscs have eyes, and all have sensors to detect chemicals, vibrations, and touch. The simplest type of molluscan reproductive system relies on external fertilization, but more complex variations occur. Nearly all produce eggs, from which may emerge trochophore larvae, more complex veliger larvae, or miniature adults. The coelomic cavity is reduced. They have an open circulatory system and kidney-like organs for excretion.
Good evidence exists for the appearance of gastropods, cephalopods, and bivalves in the Cambrian period, 541–485.4 million years ago. However, the evolutionary history both of molluscs' emergence from the ancestral Lophotrochozoa and of their diversification into the well-known living and fossil forms are still subjects of vigorous debate among scientists.

Molluscs have been and still are an important food source for humans. Toxins that can accumulate in certain molluscs under specific conditions create a risk of food poisoning, and many jurisdictions have regulations to reduce this risk. Molluscs have, for centuries, also been the source of important luxury goods, notably pearls, mother of pearl, Tyrian purple dye, and sea silk. Their shells have also been used as money in some preindustrial societies.
A handful of mollusc species are sometimes considered hazards or pests for human activities. The bite of the blue-ringed octopus is often fatal, and that of Enteroctopus dofleini causes inflammation that can last over a month. Stings from a few species of large tropical cone shells of the family Conidae can also kill, but their sophisticated, though easily produced, venoms have become important tools in neurological research. Schistosomiasis (also known as bilharzia, bilharziosis, or snail fever) is transmitted to humans by water snail hosts, and affects about 200 million people. Snails and slugs can also be serious agricultural pests, and accidental or deliberate introduction of some snail species into new environments has seriously damaged some ecosystems.</h2>

<h1><u>Scotoplanes</u></h1>
<h2>Members of the Elpidiidae have particularly enlarged tube "feet" that have taken on a leg-like appearance, using water cavities within the skin to inflate and deflate thereby causing the appendages to move.[2] These appendages are different from the normal tube feet of the broader order of Elasipodida due the replacement of ampullae with dermal cavities to account for the larger size of the Elpidiidae tube feet. Scotoplanes move through the top layer of seafloor sediment and disrupt both the surface and the resident infauna as they feed.[3] This type of movement is thought to be an adaptation to life on the soft floor of the deep sea. These creatures, however, can swim when disturbed. Some species of Scotoplanes are benthopelagic and spend plenty of time in the water column. A frontal lobe as well as two anal lobes propel the sea pig through the water. Their tentacles help detect their surroundings while moving.[4]

<h1><u>Australonuphis</u></h1>

<h2>Australonuphis, commonly called Australian beach worms, are a genus of polychaetous annelids of the family Onuphidae that inhabit the intertidal zone of coastal beaches and are attracted to the surface by the stimulus of food. They are sought by anglers to be used as bait for fishing. Some species can grow more than two metres in length.[1][2] They are blind but have a very good sense of smell, and eat decaying meat, fish and seaweeds that have washed to shore.[3]</h2>

<h1><u>Jellyfish</u></h1>
<h2>Jellyfish, also known as sea jellies or simply jellies, are the medusa-phase of certain gelatinous members of the subphylum Medusozoa, which is a major part of the phylum Cnidaria. Jellyfish are mainly free-swimming marine animals, although a few are anchored to the seabed by stalks rather than being motile. They are made of an umbrella-shaped main body made of mesoglea, known as the bell, and a collection of trailing tentacles on the underside.

Via pulsating contractions, the bell can provide propulsion for locomotion through open water. The tentacles are armed with stinging cells and may be used to capture prey or to defend against predators. Jellyfish have a complex life cycle, and the medusa is normally the sexual phase, which produces planula larvae. These then disperse widely and enter a sedentary polyp phase which may include asexual budding before reaching sexual maturity.</h2>

<h1>Stonefish</h1>
<h2>Synanceia is a genus of ray-finned fish belonging to the subfamily Synanceiinae, the stonefish, which is classified within the family Scorpaenidae, the scorpionfish and relatives. Stonefish are the most venomous fish known; stings can be fatal to humans.[2][3] They are found in the coastal regions of the Indo-Pacific. They are sometimes confused with the freshwater lionfish.</h2>
